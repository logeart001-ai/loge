## Row-Level Security (RLS)

The events table has RLS policies:

- **Organizer Update/Delete**: Only the event organizer can modify/delete their events
- **Admin Full Access**: Admin users have full control over all events

## Frontend Integration

Events created here will automatically appear:

1. **Events Page** (`/events`): All published events
2. **Homepage**: Featured events in the "Upcoming Events" section
3. **Event Queries**: The `getUpcomingEvents()` function fetches events from this table

## Sample Data

One sample event was created during the migration:

- **Title**: "Contemporary Nigerian Art Exhibition"
- **Type**: Exhibition
- **Date**: December 15, 2024
- **Location**: Lagos, Nigeria
- **Status**: Published and Featured

You can edit or delete this sample event as needed.

## Tips for Best Practices

1. **Featured Events**: Only feature 3-5 events at a time for optimal homepage display
2. **Event Dates**: Keep events up to date and remove or unpublish past events
3. **Descriptions**: Write clear, engaging descriptions to attract attendees
4. **Pricing**: Use realistic prices in Naira (â‚¦)
5. **Multi-day Events**: For events spanning multiple days, fill in both start_date and end_date
6. **Draft Mode**: Use unpublished status to prepare events before going live

## Troubleshooting

### "You must be logged in to create events"
- Ensure you're logged in to the admin account
- Check that your session hasn't expired

### Events not appearing on frontend
- Verify the event is marked as **Published**
- Check that the event_date is valid
- Refresh the homepage or events page

### Can't edit/delete an event
- Only the event organizer (creator) can modify events
- Admin users should have full access via RLS policies
- Check browser console for error messages

## Next Steps

You can extend this feature by:

1. Adding image uploads for event banners
2. Creating a public event detail page
3. Adding RSVP/ticketing functionality
4. Implementing event categories or tags
5. Adding email notifications for new events
